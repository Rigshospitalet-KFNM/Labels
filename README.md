# Labels

This repository serves to provide an improved solution to printing standardized labels for the chemisty department. This program looks to replace the currently used [solution](http://hopper.petnet.rh.dk/labels/). 

## Focus

The repository should prioritize; facilitated code handovers, ease of use for the end user, and easy database management, both for users and developers.
